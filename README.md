A chess engine written with STEM education in mind. This is good starting point to learn data structures, algorithms, computer networks. It is living project with maintainable code. 

## What does this software try to achieve?
This is not meant to be a competitive chess engine with high ELO rating. By design there is no attempt to use bitfield for fast board evaluation or multiple evaluation techniques. It is meant to be simple and easy to understand and finally challenging to play against by an average chess player.
